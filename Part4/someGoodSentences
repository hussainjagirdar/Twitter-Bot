The bear came near the man lying on the ground
Cassandra fell asleep so Joaquin just went home
I don’t really like spaghetti but I can eat lasagna any day
Neither Lisa nor Helena had been to Italy before
The poor wife sat by her husband’s cage
Jack and Jill went up the hill
The crow had paid a heavy price for his foolishness
In the evening they would come and rest on their favorite tree in the forest
Her father died when she was young
stop
